// This patch fixes the double patching caused by a rogue patch on RO.
//
// The offending path is RealismOverhaul/RO_SuggestedMods/Squad/RO_Squad_Electrical.cfg
//
// and the problem happens due the original patch applying the change disregarding TweakScale being
// able to patch it or not - worse, apply it without the "%" symbol, what would double patch the part
// even if applied after TweakScale, as it should. TweakScale is partially to be blamed for now,
// as we don't use the :FOR thingy yet. But yet, the RO patches would bork the same way.
//
// If needed, copy this file to GameData/__LOCAL/TweakScale/HotFixes subdirectory.
//
// Thanks to [Buflak](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/198228-buflak/) for the help on doing this properly!
