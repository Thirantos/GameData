# TweakScale :: Hot Fixes

Due unmaintained and All Rights Reserved Add'Ons causing some breakage, it was detected the need to apply Hot Fixes on some KSP installments.

A Hot Fix is a brute force solution to reach the original intended result, but without touching the offending patch, usually due legal reasons (otherwise a proper fix would be applied to the maintainer's repository, right?)

Since the original intended behaviour of the broken Add'On is restored (even that by unorthodox ways), savegames and crafts created with such patches are OK to be shared, and will be compatible with sane KSP installments (as long using the same subset of Add'Ons, of course).

However, these patches are hand crafts to specific situations, are not for the general use. Different Add'Ons combinations can demand slightly different patches, and using the wrong patch can render the installment non compatible with sane installments.

The patches are named using the **offending** Add'On , "--" and followed by the *offended* one.
