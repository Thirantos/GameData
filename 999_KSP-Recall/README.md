## Description

Tired of constantly updating your Add'Ons each time a new KSP release fsck up something?

Restless while waiting your favorite Add'On to be updated so you can play without invoking devils on dark and incompreensible rituals?

So this Add'On is for you.

By installing this thingy, unsolved bugs and mishaops from KSP Development Team will be fixed or at least workarounded, saving Add'On Authors from the hassle to handle them themselves.

It aims to need minimal coupling with existent code, as well to be selectively injected on the broken parts in order to prevent *unholly intercations with third-party modules* that decide to fix things their own way.

Currently, the following fixes are available once installed:

* TweakScale:
	+ KSP 1.9.x resets resources to prefab while cloning parts [#96](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/TweakScale/issues/96)
* More to come! 

## For Add'On Authors

### [Issue #1](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/KSP-Recall/issues/1) KSP 1.9.x resets resources to prefab while cloning parts

Add'Ons that supports TweakScale using `Scale_Redist.dll` but do not change resources themselves will be automatically fixed - TweakScale "calls" KSP Recall as the last step of the rescaling, anything you do on `IRescalable::OnRescale(ScalingFactor factor)` will be preserved.

Add'Ons that also changes the Part's resources outside of the `OnRescale` callback or without direct support for/from TweakScale will need to add the following lines of code every time their Part Resources are changed:

```C#
            // send Resource Changed message to KSP Recall if needed
            if (0 != this.part.Resources.Count)
            {
                BaseEventDetails data = new BaseEventDetails (BaseEventDetails.Sender.USER);
                data.Set<int> ("InstanceID", this.part.GetInstanceID());
                data.Set<Type>("issuer", this.GetType ());
                part.SendEvent ("OnPartResourceChanged", data, 0);
            }

// note: If your part can be set to have <ZERO> resources, omit the "if" above to hint Recall that it should delete any internal cache for the part
```

It's **extremely** important to send this event **only at the last moment possible**, after changing the resources. There's no guarantee about when this Event will be handled (it can be handled right on the spot, or only next week - nobody knows). You can only be sure about **when it will not be handled**: before being issued. So do whatever you need, and add that lines above before the end of the function/method/procedure/whatever to avoid risking Recall caching your resources before you are done.

_Add'Ons that support TweakScale by handling the `OnPartScaleChanged` event need to add that lines above too as the last step of their scaling tasks_. Since Events are completely asynchronous, there's a good chance that by the time TweakScale sends `OnPartResourceChanged` to Recall, you could not handled yet (or be in the middle of the handling!!!) your `OnPartScaleChanged` , and so Recall will essentially undo what you had done on your part (as it will get a snapshot of the current Resources before the change).
